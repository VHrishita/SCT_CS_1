# Caesar Cipher — Encrypt & Decrypt Tool

A simple, clean, and fully client-side Caesar Cipher encryption/decryption tool built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
This project allows users to enter any message, choose a shift value, and instantly encrypt or decrypt text using the classic Caesar Cipher algorithm.

All processing happens **completely inside the browser**, no data is sent, stored, or collected.

## 🚀 How It Works

The Caesar Cipher shifts each alphabet letter forward or backward by *n* positions.

Example:  
Shift = 3 → A → D  
Shift = -3 → D → A

The algorithm:

1. Reads each character of the message
2. Checks if it is a letter
3. Converts it to ASCII
4. Applies `(char + shift) % 26`
5. Rebuilds the string with shifted characters

Non-alphabet characters can be:
- preserved (recommended)
- removed (optional)
